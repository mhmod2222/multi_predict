# Multi-Regressor predictive analysis

In this project the numbers of common insects which infect the guava trees are predicted using machine learning

The aim was to build a web application deployed on AWS EC2 instance to predict the insects numbers using some user input data as shown below:

The web application is based on python and flask. 

The input features to the application comprise weather information available to people daily.

The machine learning algorithm used in XGBoost multi-regressor.

What is difference between single and multi regressors?
-
a single regressor predicts a single output value; however, a multi regressor can predict multiple output values simulatanoeusly.
In this project, a multi regressor is used to predict the numbers of fifteen insects that infect guava trees usually
